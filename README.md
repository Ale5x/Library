LIBRARY

The app is a free online library. There are branches of the library throughout the country where you can order books.

The user orders a book and chooses which branch to deliver the book to. Later in the orders, you can view the status of the order. There is an “admin_library” in the system, which cannot be deleted or its role and status changed, unlike other entries. You can borrow a book for a subscription or in the reading room.


There are 4 roles: "Guest", "User", "Administrator", "Manager".
